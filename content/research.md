My research involves extracting phenotypic information from images of organisms. Currently I am working on a disease monitoring apparatus for dolphin populations. I am also working on incorporating disease data into ecological models. 

**I've also worked on the evolution of color patterns. Here are the projects I worked on for my dissertation:**

* The role of eyespots in the evolution of defensive traits 

* Systematically quantifying discrete color classes in organisms

* How color and pattern diversity in reef fishes relates to broad categorizations of ecology

* Biographic patterns of color and pattern diversity across marine fishes
