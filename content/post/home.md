I'm Liz Karan, an evolutionary biologist whose work aims to understand how the diversity we observe across reef fishes came to be. I'm interested in comparative methods, developing high-throughput tools for macroevolutionary studies, and ecological applications of machine learning. I'm currently a PhD Candidate at the University of California, Los Angeles with [Michael Alfaro, PhD](https://michaelalfaro.github.io/alfaro-lab/).
